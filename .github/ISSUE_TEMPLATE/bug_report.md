**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

Linking a minimal project that reproduces the issue may help.
Important rules when making such project:
- Keep it to a minimum, if possible no steps required after launching, or just press one key or button to trigger the test. The more complicated a project is, the more effort it takes to inspect, understand and isolate the issue.
- Remove any scripts, nodes and assets that aren't necessary to reproduce the issue.
- Don't use fullscreen or large screen size.
- If scripts are needed, prefer GDScript, as C# is harder to setup
- Don't embed scripts or shaders inside resource or scenes, save them as their own files
- Prefer resources in text format (.tres, .tscn) instead of binary

If you see any errors in the console, that may also help.
